<p>The landscape of interaction design is a mess. But messes have a way of also bringing about opportunities, don’t they?
Examples abound of inappropriate and unnecessary technology masquerading as innovation. Look at the 2015 Consumer Electronics 
Show from last month; it featured a bewildering array of innovation box-checking, ranging from touchscreen fridges to dashboards thattake your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road. But any modern innovation manager can slap a touchscreen on a product and tell you what it adds over its analog counterpart. I believe it’s just as important to consider what is being lost.</p>

<h2 id="paragraph1">Back to the Future</h2>

<p>I want interaction designers to remember where we came from in order to stay mindful of where we’re going. In the early 20th century, interaction design wasn’t much of a career because there simply wasn’t any need for it. Mechanical devices were controlled physically and directly, period. A lathe handle turned a gear that turned the lathe in the same direction. You could design the handle to fit the human hand a bit better, but otherwise you didn’t have to solve any deep cognitive interaction problems such as, “How will this interface be understood, and valued by the user? What role does metaphor play? What does this interaction say about our brand?”</p>

<p>An early example of interaction design that resembles what we do today is the typewriter. You remember those, don’t you? They were like a word processor and a printer all in one, but with infinite battery life.</p>

<p>Though strictly mechanical, typewriters do, after all, have a one-to-one relationship between buttons (aka keys) and their actions. Nonetheless, somebody thought to layout those buttons in a very specific non-linear way and in an abstract order according to letter frequency in the English language—itself an abstract concept. The layout also took into consideration tactile human factors such as physical reach of average fingers and the distance between each button. There’s a reason Q and Z are so awkward to get to and ASDF are not.</p>

<p>This innovation was further humanized with the introduction of a patented key curvature that subtly mirrors your finger shape. Here we have an early example of human interaction, and one whose near-perfect design has barely changed in 140 years. Even though a typewriter is quite an abstract device, we’ve come to see it as natural, human, primitive, and even emotive.</p>
