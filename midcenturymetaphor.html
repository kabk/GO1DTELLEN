<h2 id="paragraph2">Mid-century metaphor</h2>
<p>Human interaction is so basic and natural and yet as our tools have evolved, 
we’ve struggled with the conversation between abstract and tangible—between digital and analog.
 I can’t think of a more abstract invention or one that highlights this dialog better than the personal computer. 
Computers of the mid-century could compute anything today’s machines can, just more slowly. 
But, in hindsight, speed wasn’t the barrier to mass adoption. The real problem was that humankind had invented 
the most powerful machine in the history of history and yet almost nobody knew how to use it, or really even cared.</p>

<p>The breakthrough moment for the digital age wasn’t just the addition of monitors and keyboards, 
nor was it the miniaturization that semiconductors introduced, astounding though that was. As I see it, 
the real coming-of-age moment was an idea alone. An idea born in the 1970s and which would humanize this 
beast and turn it into everyone’s current superpower. The Graphic User Interface; the greatest idea in interaction design. Ever.</p>

<p>The first GUI came from Xerox’s astonishingly overlooked Palo Alto Research Center, 
where I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall (or beanbag chair). 
The history of PARC and how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs appropriated everything of value away 
from Xerox is by now well known (and if not, watch Triumph of the Nerds immediately). 
Suffice it to say that everything we now know as modern computing: the networked office, tablets, icons, menus, email 
(and this list goes on) was hatched then and there. But at the top of that list is the GUI and the 
deceptively simple introduction of the “Desktop Metaphor.”</p>

<p>This metaphor transformed our perception of computers from abstract geek tools understood by only a 
few dozen people, to the tangible new superpower every kid is now in command of.
All because the metaphor gave us a way to interpret the digital world in terms of tangible things we already
 understand how to manipulate (i.e. paper, folders, trashcans, scissors, glue etc.). This mash up of abstract and 
tangible is now such a part of our modern lives that I recently found myself trying to pinch and zoom a real photograph, 
much like toddlers who assume every magazine is an iPad. Granted I was exhausted at the time, but this highlights how 
closely the GUI approximates how we’ve come to think, and vice versa.</p>
