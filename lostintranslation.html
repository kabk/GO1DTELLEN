<p>Ultimately, we can do research in dozens of countries and hundreds of focus groups, to discover how people relate to their tools, uncovering what it is about certain experiences that are useful, usable and desirable. But for me it’s just as illuminating to watch my 6-month-old son at play. He loves the tactile things around him: the clicks, the twists, the bubble wrap, the bells, the blocks.</p>

<p>Even as adults, using incredibly complex devices at the forefront of human achievement, the best micro interactions still come from the direct, human, physical, analogness of our senses. (Google’s Material UI gets the balance right). It’s fundamentally how we encounter and understand the world around us, and yet it’s easy to forget that when designing all new experiences, whether in retail, digital, or consumer electronics.<p>


<p>Any of us working in innovation design ought to be able to articulate—in really simple terms—not just what problem we’re solving, but also to radically simplify features that are there for their own sake. Ultimately, we translate these interactions into human, sensual, emotive, and functional expressions. This sounds simple, but simplicity is hard. It’s all too easy to “put a touchscreen on it” in order to check the innovation box. But what do we lose when do that?</p>
